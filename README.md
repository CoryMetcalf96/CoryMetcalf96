** CURRENTLY OPEN TO WORK **

** You can find my [portfolio here!](https://corymetcalfportfolio.com) **

Welcome! My name is Cory and I'm a **full-stack software engineer**. I recently graduated from **General Assembly's 480+ hour Software Engineering Immersive** program. Programming grew from an early hobby to my career path over the last few years and I spend time every day learning and growing in this field. *Everything from front-end website design to algorithm deep-diving and database management-* I pride myself in my ability to adapt quickly and follow through with any project passionately.

**Favorite Projects (As pinned below):**

[AppTrack](https://apptrack2022.herokuapp.com/) - AppTrack was my fourth project through GeneralAssembly. It was my solution to the job-search process and a way to keep everything as organized as possible. Powered by Python / Django, this application allows you to add applications along the way and track / filter them based on priority and application status.

[Avatar Yearbook](https://avatar-yearbook.netlify.app/) - My first collaborative experience, I took on the role of lead front-end engineer for our social media app. It's an application that we created in an effort to share our information within the cohort, have links to everyones portfolios and social media, and flex our CRUD capabilities and CSS conditionals.

[Mindfull](https://project-mindfull.herokuapp.com/todo) - A full-stack application that works as a personal planner for the user. With the ability to journal, create a to-do list, and set a morning / nighttime routine, this was one of my first dives in to fully vanilla CSS, object management, ect.

[Books vs. Movies](https://booksvsmovies.netlify.app) - One of my first in-depth projects so it will always have a special place in my heart: Accessing Google API's, creating a base search engine that checks and compares books vs. their movie version and vice versa.
