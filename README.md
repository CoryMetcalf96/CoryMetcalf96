Welcome! My name is Cory and I'm a **full-stack software engineer currently going through the General Assembly program**. Programming grew from an early hobby to my career path over the last few years and I dabble daily in my free time. *Everything from front-end website design to algorithm practice to Python games-* I pride myself in my ability to adapt quickly and follow through with any project passionately.

**Favorite Projects:**
"Is there a book/movie?" - Using API's, creating a base search engine that checks and compares books vs. their movie version and vice versa.

**Proficient Languages:**
-Javascript
-HTML
-CSS
